    "**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a numerical statistic used in NLP to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection or corpus of documents. It combines two key measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Term Frequency (TF)**\n",
    "The frequency of a word in a specific document. It shows how often a word appears in a document, indicating its relevance within that document. Words that appear frequently have higher TF scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of times the word appears in the document}}{\\text{Total number of words in the document}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**\n",
    "A measure of how unique or rare a word is across all documents in the corpus. Common words that appear in many documents get lower IDF scores, while rare words that appear in fewer documents get higher scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{IDF} = \\log \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing the word}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying TF and IDF, TF-IDF highlights words that are important in a specific document but not too common across all documents. It is commonly used in tasks like information retrieval, document ranking, and text mining, as it helps prioritize significant words for better text analysis.\n"

Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing.

A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and I'm still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film I've seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.</td>\n",

       "0  Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1  This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and I'm still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film I've seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...<br /><br />Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "1  this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. a complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of ice-t and ice cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. don't bother with this one, go see new jack city, ricochet or watch new york undercover for ice-t, or boyz n the hood, higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal. ice-t's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and i'm still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film? and why the heck does he always play the exact same character? from aliens onward, every film i've seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...<br /><br />overall, this is second-rate action trash. there are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch judgement night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.   \n",
